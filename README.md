# Hero - Course Format

A course format for Moodle that has a large "hero" image in the course.

This is a good course format for courses with only small amounts of content.
It can be used instead of the single activity format where you want to include some additional data.

It has configurable sections that allow for easy display of course summary information.

Each course section (topic) is displayed on its own page.

The side of the page (left or right) that the hero image appears on can be set in the format settings.
